This file contains the saved Random Forest machine learning model created during training using joblib.
It is used for:
    -> Deployment         - Deployment in applications such as Flask, Django, or Streamlit
    -> Future predictions - Future predictions without needing to retrain the model
    -> Faster loading     - Faster loading of the pretrained model for evaluation and testing

Saving the model ensures that the final trained version can be reused anytime without repeating the entire training process.
