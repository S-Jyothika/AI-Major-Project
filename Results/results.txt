==> After training four different machine learning models on the Heart Disease dataset, the following results were obtained.  
==> All evaluation metrics are based on the test data (20% split).  

## 1. Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 78.68%
- Precision: 0.76
- Recall: 0.87
- F1-Score: 0.81
- ROC-AUC: 0.77
Confusion Matrix:`results/logistic_regression_confusion_matrix.png`  
This model performed well in identifying patients with heart disease (high recall), but struggled slightly with correctly identifying non-disease cases.

## 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- Accuracy: 70.49%
- Precision: 0.70
- Recall: 0.78
- F1-Score: 0.74
- ROC-AUC: 0.69
Confusion Matrix:`results/decision_tree_confusion_matrix.png`  
The Decision Tree shows signs of overfitting, resulting in lower accuracy compared to other models.

## 3. Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: 81.96%
- Precision: 0.76
- Recall: 0.96
- F1-Score: 0.85
- ROC-AUC: 0.80
Confusion Matrix:`results/random_forest_confusion_matrix.png`  
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, best F1-score, and strong generalization, making it the best-performing model among all.

## 4. Neural Network (MLP Classifier)
- Accuracy: 78.68%
- Precision: 0.79
- Recall: 0.81
- F1-Score: 0.80
- ROC-AUC: 0.78
Confusion Matrix:`results/neural_network_confusion_matrix.png`  
The Neural Network shows fairly balanced performance but slightly below Random Forest.

## Overall Comparison
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 78.68% |
| Decision Tree | 70.49% |
| Random Forest | **81.96%** |
| Neural Network | 78.68% |

## Best Model Conclusion
**Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best performance:  
==> Highest Accuracy (81.96%)  
==> Highest Recall (0.96)  
==> Strong F1-Score (0.85)  
==> Most robust predictions
