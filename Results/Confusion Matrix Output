This file contains the confusion matrix generated from the Random Forest model.
It represents:
    -> True Positives (TP): 22
    -> True Negatives (TN): 15
    -> False Positives (FP): 4
    -> False Negatives (FN): 2
The confusion matrix helps evaluate how accurately the Random Forest model predicts heart disease, showing correctly and incorrectly classified cases.
